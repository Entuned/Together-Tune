# Together-Tune

*  start mongo db locally or external server instance
*  open up localhost 3000
*  Spotify must be opened on logged in users device
#### User Experience
*  After User logs in, clicking on a playlist will play the first song   of that playlist. But it only works if you have your own spotify application open in the desktop.
* User must add a friend to be able to chat with friends P.S : (Drop Database before using the chat feature and insert friends username to establish chat connection).

*  BUG Spotify sometimes must be currently playing for the first pause to work
*  good luck ;)
